# Types

## Primitive Types
> All "primitive", or built-in data types in JavaScript are recongized by TypeScript.

> *some examples below*

> `"Hello, world! // string`

> `42  // string`

> `true // boolean`

> `null`

> `undefined`

## TypeScript Type Inference
> Type inference assumes the expected type of the variable throughout a program based on the data type of the value intially assigned to it at declaration. Type inference will log a complaint if the variable is later reassigned to a different type.

> `let first = 'Anders'`

> `first = 1337; // Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'`

## The Shape of an Object
> TypeScript knows the *shape* of an object - what memeber properties it does or doesn't contain. TypeScript will log an error if the code attempts to access members of an object known not to exist. It may even suggest possible corrections.

> `let firstName= 'muriel!'`

> `console.log(firstName.toUppercase());`

> `// error: Property 'toUppercase' does not exist on type 'string'. Did you mean 'toUpperCase'?`

## TypeScript any
> When a variable is declared without being assigned an intial value, TypeScript considers it to be of type **any**. A variable of this type can be reassigned without generating any error from TypeScript.

> `let first;`

> `first = 'Anders';`

> `first = 1337;`

## TypeScript Supports Type Annotations
> Adding a type annotation ensures that a variable can only ever be assigned to that type. This can be useful when declaring a variable without an initial value. Type annotations get removed when compiled to JavaScript. The type declaration is provided by appending a variable with a colon (:) and the type (eg. number).

> `let first: string`

> `first = 'Anders';`

> `// Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'`

> `first = 1337;`
